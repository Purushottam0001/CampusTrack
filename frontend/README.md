## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

* Gradient headers on profile and admin dashboard.
* Custom scrollbars for post lists.
* Interactive buttons with hover and transition effects.
* Visual distinction between resolved/unresolved posts.
* User profile verification badges.

## 🔐 Authentication Handling

* JWT stored in `localStorage` (`ll_token`).
* Token automatically included in Axios requests.
* Frontend redirects unauthenticated users to login if necessary.
* Profile and admin pages use token to fetch data securely.

---

## 📝 Notes

* Frontend fully manages **state, UI updates, modals, filters, and data display**.
* Backend implementation is abstracted; frontend only consumes API endpoints.
* Admin actions like cleanup or deletion are **confirmed via modal dialogs** to prevent accidental actions.
